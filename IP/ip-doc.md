Love this direction. A **hybrid model + clean 50/50 founder split** is a very solid, grown-up choice for what you’re building. Let’s turn this into a **clear, low-drama plan** you can actually execute.

I’ll break this into **four layers**, then give you **copy-paste templates** you can literally drop into a doc.

---

# BIG PICTURE (the mental model)

You’re building **three things**, not one:

1. **A mission** (public good, trust, neutrality)
2. **A platform** (software, logistics, execution)
3. **A relationship** (you + your friend, long-term)

The hybrid model keeps these from stepping on each other.

---

# 1️⃣ The Hybrid Structure (clean + standard)

### Entity A — **Nonprofit (501(c)(3))**

**Purpose:**
Mission, legitimacy, neutrality, public trust

**Owns:**

* The *mission*
* The *brand* (name, logo)
* The *core IP* (licensed out)
* Governance principles
* Data ethics framework

**Does NOT:**

* Build software day-to-day
* Sell SaaS directly
* Employ engineers full-time (usually)

---

### Entity B — **For-profit Subsidiary (LLC or C-Corp)**

**Purpose:**
Professional execution, sustainability, velocity

**Does:**

* Builds and operates the platform
* Runs integrations
* Provides support, SLAs, hosting
* Contracts with municipalities / NGOs

**Relationship:**

* Licensed by the nonprofit
* Pays revenue / profit share back to nonprofit
* Accountable via governance agreement

📌 **Key idea:**
The nonprofit *controls the “why”*, the for-profit *executes the “how”*.

---

# 2️⃣ Founder Alignment (1–2 page memo)

This is **not** a legal contract yet.
It’s a **shared reality document**.

Below is a **founders memo template** you can literally use.

---

## Founders Alignment Memo (Draft)

### 1. Founders

* Founder A: __________
* Founder B: __________

Ownership intent: **50 / 50 equal partners**

---

### 2. Mission Statement (plain English)

> We are building a neutral, trusted platform that connects 501(c)(3) organizations with municipalities and regions in crisis (famine, natural disaster, war, displacement) to coordinate humanitarian aid, logistics, and planning.

---

### 3. What Each Founder Built

* Founder A contributed:

  * ---
* Founder B contributed:

  * ---

Both founders agree that **all existing and future work is jointly owned**, subject to assignment to the project entities.

---

### 4. IP Ownership (Intent)

* All code, infrastructure, documentation, and designs:

  * Will be **assigned to the nonprofit**
* The for-profit entity:

  * Will receive an **exclusive or primary license** to operate the platform

No founder retains personal ownership of core IP.

---

### 5. Decision-Making

* Strategic decisions (mission, structure, dissolution): **mutual consent**
* Day-to-day execution: **division of responsibilities**, resolved collaboratively
* If disagreement persists:

  * Pause deployment
  * Seek neutral third-party advice (advisor / board member)

---

### 6. If One Founder Walks Away

* Departing founder:

  * Retains **equity already vested**
  * Does not block project continuation
* IP remains with the entities
* Non-compete limited to **direct copies of the platform**

---

### 7. If This Becomes Big

* Both founders agree:

  * Mission integrity > short-term profit
  * No sale that compromises humanitarian neutrality
  * Any acquisition must preserve nonprofit control or mission lock

---

### 8. Good Faith Clause

> We commit to operating with transparency, respect, and shared stewardship, recognizing that this project exists to serve people in crisis.

Signed:

* ___________________ Date: _______
* ___________________ Date: _______

---

If you want, I can **tighten this into legal-ready language** later.

# 3️⃣ IP Strategy (very important, very doable)

Your proposed split is *excellent*. Let’s formalize it.

## What stays OPEN (builds trust & adoption)

* **APIs**
* **Schemas**
* **Crisis data formats**
* **Interoperability standards**
* Possibly: SDKs

License suggestions:

* Apache 2.0 or MIT (very standard)
* Clear contribution guidelines

Why:

* Encourages adoption
* Prevents lock-in fears
* Makes governments comfortable

---

## What stays PROTECTED (keeps quality & sustainability)

* Core orchestration logic
* Matching & prioritization algorithms
* UX flows for crisis coordination
* Integrations with external systems
* Hosting & operational tooling

Protection method:

* Copyright
* Trade secret
* Licensing (not patents, usually)

📌 **Important:**
Protected ≠ secret from partners.
It just means **controlled stewardship**.

---

# 4️⃣ Governance (this is why people trust you)

For the nonprofit, you’ll want:

### Board structure (early)

* You (Founder A)
* Your friend (Founder B)
* 1–2 independent advisors (humanitarian / municipal / logistics)

### Governance principles (short but powerful)

* Neutrality
* Transparency
* No political prioritization
* Data minimization
* Auditability
* Human-in-the-loop decisions for aid prioritization

This is a *huge credibility multiplier*.

---

# 5️⃣ Revenue Flow (simple version)

Example:

* For-profit charges:

  * Municipal subscriptions
  * Support contracts
  * Enterprise integrations
* For-profit pays:

  * License fee or % of revenue to nonprofit
* Nonprofit uses funds for:

  * Grants
  * Platform access subsidies
  * Expansion to under-resourced regions

This keeps you solvent **and** ethical.

---

# 6️⃣ What I’d suggest you do next (very concrete)

### Week 1

* Put the **Founders Memo** in Google Docs
* Fill it out together
* Agree on:

  * Hybrid model
  * 50/50 split
  * IP assignment intent

### Week 2

* Choose entity names
* Form **LLC or C-Corp first**
* Assign IP to holding entity (temporary if needed)

### Week 3–4

* Form nonprofit
* Transfer IP formally
* Draft license agreement between entities

---

# 7️⃣ I can help you with (next steps)

If you want, I can:

* Convert your founders memo → legal-grade agreement
* Draft IP assignment + license terms
* Design nonprofit bylaws
* Create a governance & ethics charter
* Help you pitch this to foundations or municipalities

### Final question (important):

👉 Do you already have a **name** for the platform / org, or is that still open?

That answer affects **IP, branding, and structure**, so we’ll nail it next.
