---

## 6. No Financial Obligation

This MoU does not create any financial obligation between the parties. The Partner is not entitled to compensation from Hromada for activities under this MoU unless a separate written agreement governs such compensation. Hromada does not guarantee any minimum volume of projects, funding, or referrals to the Partner.

**Co-Financing Commitments.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Partner has provided a written co-financing commitment for a specific project prior to that project being published on the Hromada platform, the following shall apply:

a. Such written co-financing commitment shall constitute a firm obligation upon which Hromada will rely in soliciting donor funds for that project and presenting the project's financing structure to donors.

b. If the Partner determines that it cannot fulfill a co-financing commitment **before** the project is published on the Hromada platform and before donor funds have been solicited in reliance on that commitment, the Partner shall notify Hromada in writing immediately. In such case, Hromada shall have discretion to pause the project, seek alternative co-financing arrangements, or terminate this MoU, depending on the circumstances and the impact on project viability.

c. If the Partner withdraws, repudiates, or fails to fulfill a co-financing commitment **after** the project has been published on the Hromada platform and donor funds have been solicited in reliance on that commitment, the following consequences shall apply automatically and without discretion, regardless of the stated reason for withdrawal — including force majeure: (i) this MoU shall terminate immediately; and (ii) Hromada shall refund all affected donors whose contributions were solicited in reliance on the Partner's co-financing commitment.

d. The distinction between paragraphs (b) and (c) above exists to protect donor trust. Donors who contribute to a project do so in reliance on the financing structure presented to them, including any stated co-financing from the Partner. Withdrawal of a co-financing commitment after donors have contributed in reliance on it is a breach of that reliance regardless of the reason. The automatic termination and refund provision in paragraph (c) is designed to prevent the use of force majeure or other claims as a mechanism to avoid co-financing obligations after donor funds have been committed.

## 7. Confidentiality

Each party agrees to treat as confidential any non-public information received from the other party in connection with this MoU, including but not limited to: personal data of municipal officials, donor information, financial details, and internal operational documents. Confidential information shall not be disclosed to third parties without the disclosing party's prior written consent, except as required by applicable law.

---

## 8. Data Protection

The Partner agrees to handle any personal data received from Hromada (including names, contact information, and financial details of municipal officials, contractors, or other individuals) in accordance with applicable Ukrainian and EU data protection law. The Partner shall implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect such data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.

---

## 9. Liability and Indemnification

a. Each party shall be responsible for its own acts and omissions in connection with this MoU. Neither party assumes liability for the acts, omissions, or obligations of the other.

b. The Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Hromada and POCACITO Network from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses arising out of the Partner's breach of this MoU, including but not limited to any violation of Sections 4.4 (Sanctions Compliance), 4.5 (Anti-Corruption), or 6 (Co-Financing Commitments).

d. Sections 4.4 (Sanctions Compliance), 4.5 (Anti-Corruption), 6 (Co-Financing Commitments), 7 (Confidentiality), and 9 (Liability and Indemnification) shall survive termination of this MoU.

---

If the dispute cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days, either party may refer the matter to mediation. This MoU shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States.

---
