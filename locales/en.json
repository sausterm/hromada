      "a1": "Every community listed here chose to be listed — the tradeoff between visibility and risk is theirs to make. Beyond that, our map shows needs, not existing infrastructure. We don't publish exact site coordinates, and access is geoblocked in Russia and Belarus.",
      "q2": "How do I know my donation actually reaches Ukraine?",
      "a2": "We provide wire transfer confirmations, on-site photos during installation, and live monitoring data once systems are operational. Every project has a public transparency report.",
      "q3": "Who are your partners in Ukraine?",
      "a3": "We work directly with municipal governments and licensed electrical contractors. All partners are vetted and have completed previous installations.",
      "q4": "What if a project isn't funded in full?",
      "a4": "Projects are funded in full by a single donor — that's how we guarantee completion. Some projects have co-financing partners covering up to 20%. For pooled or smaller donations, see our Municipal Partnership Program.",
      "q5": "Is my donation tax-deductible?",
      "a5": "Yes. Donations are made to POCACITO Network, a registered 501(c)(3) (EIN 99-0392258). Your donation is tax-deductible as allowed by law."
